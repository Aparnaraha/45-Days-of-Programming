If we want to print something on screen exactly, we need to put that text in double quotes, 
otherwise error will come. For eg. cout << "code";

careerlabs 
career labs
Correct Answer
Solution Description
The text will be printed exactly like we placed inside double quotes. So first we are printing "career".
 After printing, our cursor will be right next to the 'r' of "carrer". So "labs" will be printed right 
 next to the "career" without any spaces between them.

long
float
double 
short
Correct Answer
Solution Description
Out of all given options, only float and double can hold decimal numbers. Size of the float 
is 4 bytes and double is 8 bytes (in most of the compilers, as the size of data types is compiler
specific). So double can store bigger decimal numbers.

Correct Answer
Solution Description
In c++, when we print the value of a bool variable, it prints either 0 (for false) or 1 
(for true). It doesn't print "true" or "false".

Error
Correct Answer
Solution Description
We are asking two integer values from user and input is "5 15" (without quotes). So 5 
will be assigned to a and 15 will be assigned to b. We can enter multiple input values 
either separated by space or in new lines. Hence, the result will be 20.

What will be the output of following statement ?
 cout << (‘a’ + 1);
Answer
98
Type here
Correct Answer
Solution Description
When you add a character and an integer, answer is also an integer. It will add the ASCII value of  
char ‘a’ i.e 97  and int 1. So answer will be 98.

Answer
99
Type here
Correct Answer
Solution Description
When we put char 'c' into an integer, its ASCII value will be put in the integer i.e. 99.

{
       char c = 74;
       cout << c;
       return 0;
}
Answer
J
Type here
Correct Answer
Solution Description
When we assign an integer to a character variable, that integer will be treated as ASCII value of 
corresponding character. 74 is ASCII value of letter 'J'. Hence, 'J' will be printed.

using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a = 10;
    char ch = 'a';
    ch = ch + a;
    cout << ch << endl;
}
Answer
k
Type here
Correct Answer
Solution Description
We know that the addition of a character and an integer leads to an integer. So the statement - "ch + a" 
will give the answer 107 (ASCII value of 'a' is 97). But we are assigning this integer 
now to the character variable. Hence, 107 will be saved in the variable "ch" and on printing it will 
print the character which is having ASCII value 107 i.e. 'k'.

2.5
Correct Answer
Solution Description
When 6 / 4 is performed, both the operands of / are int hence answer will be an int i.e. 1. Hence the 
value of both a and b is 1. Thus a + b will be 2. In C++, if a double value doesn't contain any decimal 
value, only integer will be printed.
